# TODO List fort the BSD Router Project
## Bugs #

* if no-mandatory /data had a fsck problem, system refuse go in single user
* add auto-trimming of all log files that are being created

## Arch #

* NEED to merge lot's of common task of create_arch_diskimage() in nanobsd

## Boot loader ##
* FreeBSD boot0 (sys/boot/i386/boot0) is highly optimized ASM code and use int 0x14 for COM port access (limited to 9600 bauds).
    => Is possible to use UART in place for highly baud rate ? 
* How to add UEFI bootloader ? (available on -current), because some x86_64 machine didn't have UEFI compability (PC Engine APU)

## Authentication #

* Need to test PAM (Radius, TACAS+) modules

## misc #

* Is utf-8 support for console usefull ?
* Quagga rc script: limit all quagga process message when quagga is disabled
* Need to publish an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) tar file
* A netgraph documentation "for dummies" like this: http://nexus.org.ua/weblog/message/406/
* Patch to routing branch: fast.diff usage: make sure you have you're gw as static lle (arp -s) and issue `route -n get gw-addr -proto1`. Then all IPv4 fast forwarding will use this gw rte/lle w/o lookup.

## TRIM ##

Adding a rc script that automatically enable TRIM on /dev/ufs/BSDRP* if:
sudo camcontrol identify ada0 | grep TRIM | cut -d ' ' -f 5
give "yes"

## labs #

* PAM: tacacs+, radius, ldap, etc
* Lab script: Generate a lab diagram in DOT language, see example in tools/bsdrp.lab.gv
* Lab script: Add a libvirt script

## nanobsd patches to study for inclusion #
